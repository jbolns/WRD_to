# WRD to (HTML)
A VBA script to convert (simple) Word documents into HTML.

Helpful when you write a lot in Word (e.g., op-eds, journal articles, data analysis briefs) and need to frequently upload to HTML-driven websites.

### Notes
- The script is given as a *.bas* file, which can be imported easily into Word's VBA console.
- Alternatively, the *testFiles* folder contains a Word document with the script preloaded and dummy text, for testing.
- The *jpg* file in the *testFiles* folder is also for testing.

### Pending:
- [ ] Documentation. Currently, you would need to read the VBA code to understand the script's capacities and limitations, and how it works.
- [ ] Images. The script currently supports image conversion, but this aspect of the script could be improved significantly.
- [ ] Tables. Currently, the file does not support table conversion.
- [ ] Markdown support. Once all kinks are resolved, it should be possible to add an option to convert to Markdown.

## Usage/Licensing
I honestly have not thought about this just yet. I *really* do not think the project is yet at production or even pilot-testing level. So, for now, let's say it's all rights reserved.
